  # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds.
  # This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while
  # still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in
  # the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable,
  # but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the
  # coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is
  # transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack
  # will stop the robot.
